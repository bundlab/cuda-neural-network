# 🚀 CUDA Neural Network in C++ (GPU Accelerated)

A fully GPU-powered **Neural Network implemented from scratch in C++ + CUDA**, including:

- Forward propagation on GPU
- Backpropagation on GPU
- ReLU activation + gradients
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) updates

This project is a strong foundation for building custom deep learning frameworks and high-performance AI systems without relying on external libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
